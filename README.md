# ts_dataset a TypeScript module for working with datasetd

The [dataset project](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset) provides a JSON API for JSON object storage via the datasetd application. This repository hosts a TypeScript module targeting [Deno](https://deno.land) for integrating datasetd JSON API managed dataset collections.

## Introduction

The TypeScript **ts_dataset** module is for working with the JSON API provided by [datasetd](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset/datasetd_api.5.html). There are two exported classes defined -- `DatasetApiClient` and `Dataset`. The first is a low level HTTP wrapper mapping basic dataset verbs to the JSON API. The later provides those verbs where the objects are TypeScript based. Most applications using dataset collections hosted via datasetd will use the latter class.

Here's a simple example of exercising some of the method available with the Dataset object. This demo code assumes datasetd running on localhost on port 8485 and a dataset set collection called "my_objects.ds" has been defined the in YAML configuration of datasetd.

~~~typescript
import { Dataset } from "https://caltechlibrary.github.io/ts_dataset/mod.ts"; 

const port = 8485;
const c_name = "my_objects.ds";

const ds = new Dataset(port, c_name);

// Get a list of keys 
let keys = await ds.keys();
console.log(`there are ${keys.length} object(s) found in ${c_name}`);
// Create a new object
let key = "object_key_three";
let obj = {
    "one": 1,
    "two": "number 2",
    "three": true,
    "updated": (new Date).toISOString()
};

await ds.create(key, obj);
keys = await ds.keys()
console.log(`there are now ${keys.length} object(s) found in ${c_name}`);

// Read back an object
let nObj = await ds.read(key);
console.log(`this is the read object ${JSON.stringify(nObj, null, "  ")}`);

// Update our object.
obj.updated = (new Date).toLocaleString();
await ds.update(key, obj);

// Read back updated object
nObj = await ds.read(key);
console.log(`this is the now our object ${JSON.stringify(nObj, null, "  ")}`);

// Remove our object
await ds.delete(key);

keys = await ds.keys()
console.log(`there are now ${keys.length} object(s) found in ${c_name}`);

## Installation

`ts_dataset` is a TypeScript module targeting Deno. Installation can be done via an import statement in your TypeScript module. You can also clone the GitHub repository at <https://caltechlibrary.github.io/ts_dataset>. The from value in your import statement should point to <https://caltechlibrary.github.io/ts_dataset/mod.ts> if you want to use it that way. Similarly you can add it to your project's `deps.ts` file with a line like.

~~~typescript
export * from "https://caltechlibrary.github.io/ts_dataset/mod.ts";
~~~

`ts_dataset` is only useful in conjunction with a running [dataset](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset) web service. This is provided by datasetd available as part of installing dataset. See the GitHub repo <https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset> for more details.

## Requirements

- [dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases) >= 2.1.13, provides datasetd
- [deno](https://deno.land) >= 1.44
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) (recommended for running the demo)
- To generation or release ts_dataset you need the following
  - [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) > 3.1
  - [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
  - [PageFind](https://pagefind.app)

To (re)generate the website content clone this repository, change into it and run "make".

## Run demo

I use tmux to run the [demo](demo_ts_dataset.ts). It's convenient. I start with one window and get everything setup and startup datasetd using a Deno task. Then I split the window and run the demo.  Below is what I type to run the demo (comments indicate where to switch windows, explain actions).

~~~shell
# Start up tmux
tmux
# clone this repository and change directory
git clone https://github.com/caltechlibrary/ts_dataset
cd ts_dataset
# Use deno tasks to setup our test and demo dataset collections
deno task setup_datasets
# Start the datasetd
deno task run_datasetd
# Split the tmux window (e.g. Ctrl-b ") and run the demo
deno task demo
~~~

## Known issues and limitations

- this is a proof of concept only
- only has small subset of dataset features
- it is very experimental and subject to change
- it is not suitable for production
